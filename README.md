# Reflection
1. Steps taken
    - Run test for single class file
    - Make note of error message
    - Follow stack trace to help narrow down problem
    - Compare code output to expected result in test file either by using pry or error message/stack trace
    - Correct code where needed
    - Complete previous steps until all tests pass

2. When I write code from the ground up, you build a foundation and each method typically adds to what was built previously.  Jumping into already developed code means you lack some of the context and understanding of what was done and why.

3. I actually prefer working with code I didn't write (which probably isn't a good thing)! I lack confidence in my own code whereas the given code provides a solid starting point.
